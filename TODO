This is a loosely-categorized list of outstanding tasks and ideas for improving
libshveu. When implementing any of these, please include an update to this TODO
file removing that task, in the same commit.

* usr /proc/cpuinfo to check for old hardware (prev-VEU5)

* add rotations other than 90 (ie. 180, 270), flip etc.

Simpler API
	* line pitch is only useful for cropping. Instead of having the user
	supply line pitch, specify a crop rectangle.
	[Or, is another use of line pitch to skip lines? should this be added
	explicitly in the API?]
